<p>< H1 > 1. Introduction to eacpay < / H1 ></p>
Eacpay is a payment application based on earthcoin blockchain. Currently, it supports discuz, WordPress and dedecms plug-ins. Because the payment is based on blockchain, for webmasters or webmasters, you will receive EAC instead of RMB, US dollars or euros. You need to exchange EAC into RMB at the exchange. Do not use if you mind.
<br>
<p>At present, all transactions supporting EAC are www.aex.com (need to climb the wall), www.aex.cash</p>
<br>
<p>Eacpay is a free, anonymous, ultra-low handling fee payment channel that the webmaster can control. Website users pay directly to the webmaster's EAC wallet without going through a third party and don't have to worry about deducting fees and running away; Moreover, there is no need for third-party audit, business license, ID card and domain name without filing; Without the complicated configuration of Alipay and WeChat, the configuration is super simple, provided that the EAC address can be provided. The payment amount is unlimited</ p>
<br>
<p>Disadvantages: payment confirmation is relatively centralized and payment is slow</p>
